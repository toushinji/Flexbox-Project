      <h3>(Seinfeld voice) whats the deal with flexbox?</h3>
      <p>
        Well Timmy?, err Margaret?..., I'm glad you asked, flexbox as we know or the Flexible Box Module it is a tool used to help us arrange and style our layouts to make them responsive. we are able to do so using vertial and Horizontal properties alongside
        a few directional and wrapping properties. There are also a few properties that only apply to the child element too which I will also demonstrate below.
      </p>

      <h3>How does it even work?</h3>
      <p>
        Its quite easy actually, flexbox allows us to use the CSS property "<strong class="important">display</strong>" to control the position, direction and spaceing of child elements inside the parent container. It also allows us to change the order,and
        alignment of the child elements separately. Today I will attempt to break them down for easy consumption, I will list all sources used to create this medium.

  <!--   css properties for the parent container section.   -->

  <div class="justifycontent">
    <h2 class="justifycontent__chapter">Horizontal Alignment</h2>
    <p class="justifycontent__chapter--text">
      Let's begin with the learning the different properties that will be used in the parent container. I meantioned before that with the flexbox css we can manipulate the "position, direction and spaceing of child elements" inside of the parent container.
      The key that made me understanding how flexboxes worked was remembering that they work the way we learned the coordinate system back in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to start with the main axis or the x-axis, the horizontal alignment which runs from L-To-R is a good place to start. The <strong>justify-content</strong> focuses on the L-To-R alignment so please keep that in mind.
    </p>

      Below is the demo container with 5 child elements I will use to demonstrate the different properties of flexbox. the first thing needed to be able to use these properties is to add <code class="rule">{ display:flex; }</code> in the css of the parent's
      container.
    </p>

    <div class="demoparent">
      <div class="visualbox">A</div>
      <div class="visualbox">B</div>
      <div class="visualbox">C</div>
      <div class="visualbox">D</div>
      <div class="visualbox">D</div>
    </div>

    <p>Now when we apply <code class="rule">{ display:flex; }</code> we see that the container and the elements changes from being stacked on top of each of each other to being side-by-side
    </p>

    <p class="note">Just hover over the container to see the change</p>
    <div class="demoparent__display--flex">
      <div class="visualbox">A</div>
      <div class="visualbox">B</div>
      <div class="visualbox">C</div>
      <div class="visualbox">D</div>
    </div>
    <p class="note">
      The class <em class="note">.demoparent</em> is just an example for this demonstation. your container can be named what ever you like.

    </p>

    <div class="justifycontent__display">
      <P class="justifycontent__display--text">
        Next up is the <code class="rule">{ justify-content:flex-end }</code> property. this make all the child elements inside the parent container align to the right of the container.
      </p>

      <div class="justifycontent__display--properties">
        <div class="demoparent__display--flexend">
          <div class="visualbox">A</div>
          <div class="visualbox">B</div>
          <div class="visualbox">C</div>
          <div class="visualbox">D</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
